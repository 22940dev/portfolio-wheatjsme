I'm wheat, a student and open-source developer.

I am currently a senior in University and am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.
In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects like [ViteJS](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) and [VueUse](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse). Ever since 2021 I've been a part of the [VueUse](https://github.com/vueuse) team and have been working hard to bring
new features to the library!
